This is a simple application that follows the same steps you would follow to sign in to your bank's online banking account, deposit, withdraw, transfer money, and check the account balance. The code verifies that the person has a user name and password first. If they don't, they are prompted to create both a user name and a password. Once the person has the correct credentials, they can go on and choose which transaction of the four available they want to engage: Check their balance, make a deposit, withdraw money, or make a transfer.

The program was created using Object Oriented Programming.
